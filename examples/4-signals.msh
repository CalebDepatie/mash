# Signals AKA notifications are a concept within the shell to control tasking
# Notifications can be done on a variety of things

# The accept keyword will wait for a notification, and can return a value (but doesnt have to)
val <- accept test
run echo val

# notify <signal_name> value
notify test "Hello notifications!"

# Some notification ends are given by the shell
# desktop will send a desktop notification to the user, good for alerts
notify desktop "Whose a good boy?"

# Accept can also be used on some of these shell channels
# This is essentially a 5 second sleep
accept time seconds 5

# This will run on the following monday
accept time day Monday

# To make scheduling work even simpler, an accept can be used within a loop
# This creates an infinite loop (unless you manually exit) that will run a sequence of commands every signal
for val <- accept test {

}

# Remember, accept can be used for dates
# ... Making this run every Monday
for val <- accept time day Monday {
