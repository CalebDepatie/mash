# Shells typically have some level of process control, 
# however mash exposes it in a simplistic way that is also very familiar
# to how many programming languages model multi-threading

# The fork command will run the block, function, or single instruction in a new process

fork {
  // processing
}
fork run ./2-maths.mash

# The fork command returns an identifier refering to the PID of the child process
# This will mainly be used if you want to join the process back after forking

pid <- fork {
  // processing
